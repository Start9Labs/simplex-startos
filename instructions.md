# Instructions for SimplexMQ

SimpleX is an Instant Messenger client with sophisticated privacy features. SimplexMQ is a message queue server that puts you in control of all DMs that people send you.
This is a beta release of SimplexMQ for your StartOS server. SimpleX has many privacy and configuration options and it's recommended that you get to know them.

It's also important to note that SimpleX itself is in early stages of development, so you might encounter some bugs.

Since SimpleX is constantly being updated, and since the author of this Service Wrapper will be updating the usage instructions based on end-user feedback, the instructions are currently being hosted externally:
